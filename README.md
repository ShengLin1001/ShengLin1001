### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying on **ZheJiang University** and **Moscow Aviatation University** (Master's degree, graduating in July 2024).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **material science** and **Python programming**.

- âš¡ I have developed the mymetal package for modeling and post-processing thin film materials and heterostructures. This package includes a rigorous mechanical framework for addressing the adaptation problem of complex heterojunctions, distinguishing it from traditional lattice mismatch approaches. I am skilled in calculating key material properties, including structural optimization, formation energy, deformation energy, surface energy, COHP, ICOHP, DOS, and BAND structure. Currently, my research focuses on **phase transitions and deformation control in precious metals**, alongside the study of **dislocation theory**.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me anything-I'm happy to help.
